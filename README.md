# Day 1
It includes html and css startup file. 

# Name and Main in Python
The __name__ variable (two underscores before and after) is a special Python variable. It gets its value depending on how we execute the containing script.

Sometimes you write a script with functions that might be useful in other scripts as well. In Python, you can import that script as a module in another script.

Thanks to this special variable, you can decide whether you want to run the script. Or that you want to import the functions defined in the script.

# Day 10
# Python Django framework
I did in the directory of django stuff is just Hello world in the djangp frame work and and learned how to create the setup
for django.For beginners its a tricky part to setup the enviroment but i did this in few hours.For this you need virtual 
enviroment to run the django application or project.

**Django setup**.
These are following the step to create the Python django framework Enviroment.

# Creating Environment for Python django
let spppose you have a folder on the desktop thats folder name is __my_django_stuff__ .
* __cd my_django_stuff__
* __python -m venv env__  
this command will create the virtul envirment for you with the name of env .but you need to do one more thing that is
activate the virtual environment.you can activate using this command.  
* __source /env/bin/activate__  
after this i would suggest you  to install the python django pkages.You can do this by conda pakages or pip pakages.One
more thig i wonna add here to before all of this you need to install the **python Anaconda**.install the pakages using this Command
* __pip install django__   
now you reached at that point where you can start work with django.for creating project conda pakages will facilitate you..
* __django-admin startproject projectname__
